# Tableau

### Updating the Tableau preferences file
tableau_palette.py is a short script to create new colour palettes or update existing palettes with new colours.

All colours must be defined using their hex codes in a list

To run the script, the tableau repository directory must be your current working directory. You can check the location of your tableau repository directory by opening Tableau Desktop and going to File > Repository Location...

Ensure the Preferences.tps file is in your tableau repository directory before running the script. Note: this file is automatically created for you when Tableau Desktop is installed on your computer.
